# Web-dev-resources

A collection of useful tutorials and resources for web development

##Description
This is a website that I am developing as part of my traiing in full stack web development. The brief for the project was to build a video playing platform with embeded video contents. I'm using this as an opportunity to collect resources I have found useful so far and I can continue to add to the site as I progress further.

##Acknowledgements
I used this YouTube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nywQdjKnJI to build the scrolling video bars.
